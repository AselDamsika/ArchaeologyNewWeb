			<h4>Social Geography</h4>
                <p>My research interests focus primarily on the areas of government sponsored development projects and their resettlement activities. Such areas are the interfaces of planning where outside planners and local people often contest on.  Various combinations of thoughts i.e., political economy and political ecology, spread around post development are amalgamated in the studies showing pluralistic approaches and interpretive stances as essential elements.  In addition to such academic research, keeping the above essence largely intact, I also engage in some applied research on Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and resettlement planning. All of them significantly fall within the broader subject area of Social Geography.</p>
